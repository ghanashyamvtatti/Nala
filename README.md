# Nala 🥘

**Nala** is an open-source personal cookbook application that helps you create, track, and experiment with recipes. It integrates with GitHub for version control and uses the USDA FoodData Central API for automatic nutrition calculation.

## 📜 Origin of the Name

The name **Nala** is inspired by the ancient Indian king **Nala** of the Nishada kingdom. In addition to being a skilled charioteer and warrior, King Nala was renowned as a **great cook**. 

He is attributed as the author of the **Pakadarpana** (Sanskrit: "The Mirror of Cooking"), an ancient culinary treatise. Estimated to be at least 800 years old, this text contains 751 verses describing the art of cooking, including the preparation of various dishes, the qualities of an ideal cook, and techniques that were centuries ahead for their time.

Nala aims to embody this spirit of culinary excellence and preservation of knowledge.
